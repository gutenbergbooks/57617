<p>The average home to-day has conveniences
to meet the demands of comfortable
living. The heating and
lighting are good. In nearly every
home may be found a living room where the
family assembles for rest and recreation. Here
they read, sew, chat, and discuss the news.
Similar scenes occurred in the colonial days,
but in quite a different room. The kitchen took
the place of our modern living room. The life
of the colonists centered in it, for in the kitchen
was the fireplace, often the one source of heat
in the whole house. Its warmth and cheer and
its use as a place for cooking made it the heart
of the home. Here it was that the family interests
and activities were centered; all the
family group collected here to share the joys
and sorrows of life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_ix">ix</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">HOW THE STORY CAME TO BE WRITTEN</span></h2>
<p>A Father came into the Newark Museum
to ask help of the educational
adviser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot get my children interested
in their ancestors,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They
don&rsquo;t feel any pride in being descended
from a lady who came over in the Mayflower.
They say, &lsquo;Oh, Charlie&rsquo;s uncle came over in a
private yacht, and Mike&rsquo;s brother is going
over in an aeroplane.&rsquo; What shall I do? If
we were living at the old homestead, I could
show them the hole in the shutter through
which the Indian shot their great-uncle, and the
oven by the fireside where their great-grandmother
cooked for the continental soldiers, and
the wedding dress of their grandmother. But
the old place was sold, and everything is
scattered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring your children to the Museum,&rdquo; said
the educational adviser. &ldquo;We will show them
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
colonial costumes and candle-molds and Indian
arrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try it,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;but it won&rsquo;t be
the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came a teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that I could make history
alive to my pupils. They don&rsquo;t care how
many men were killed in the battle of Monmouth,
or what the date was when Washington
crossed the Delaware.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will send you some dolls in colonial costume
and an old wool-carder,&rdquo; said the educational
adviser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the teacher. &ldquo;Of course,
those things will be better than nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was this need to see &ldquo;the real things&rdquo; that
caused the Museum to build in its big hall at
the top of the Newark Library a colonial
kitchen, and fill it with colonial furnishings.
Then the students from the Normal School
dressed up in colonial clothes and went to work
in the kitchen, spinning, making candles, and
sewing carpet rags, and explaining these
things to the children who flocked in to visit
them.</p>
<p>Next Miss Prescott began to play with the
children who flocked there, and then the Andrews
children of this story were born.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xi">xi</div>
<p>The six or eight thousand children who were
taken by their teachers to see this kitchen during
the ten weeks that it stood there, many of
whom then took their parents to see it, will
perhaps read this story about the labors, and
the play, and the love-making of Mary Jane,
with interest.</p>
<p>Any group of manual training boys and domestic
art girls can put up such a kitchen,
dress the characters, and act out such a story,
and in many American neighborhoods they can
borrow &ldquo;real things,&rdquo; for their stage properties.</p>
<p>Of course, the story was not written to stimulate
handwork or theatricals. Nor was it
written to Americanize, or re-Americanize anybody.
But simple stories without ingenuity
of plot or striking incident have always been
told by parents and grandparents and maiden
aunts to the delight of children. &ldquo;Tell us what
happened when Grandpa was a miller&rdquo;; &ldquo;Tell
us about when you went to school through the
woods&rdquo;; &ldquo;Tell us how the bear frightened
Great-Aunt.&rdquo; These are the demands of children
of all nations. The peculiarity of our
situation is that so many of our children are
step-children, half-children, adopted children.
It is a mercy that there is an inheritance not
<span class="pb" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
only of blood, but of memories, of ideas, and of
hopes.</p>
<p>If this story stimulates emulation of the real
virtues of our forefathers, who founded the
country, and hence leads to real patriotism, it
will have achieved the desire in the hearts of the
authors and publishers.</p>

<h1 title="">A DAY IN A COLONIAL HOME</h1>
<div class="pb" id="Page_1">1</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>A Day in a Colonial Home</i></span></h2>
<p>Mary Jane awoke, startled. Had
she overslept and not heeded her
father&rsquo;s call? She jumped out of
bed on to the strip of rag carpet
laid on the cold floor. The chill of the early
May morning made her shiver, and, with motherly
care, she turned and straightened the
patchwork quilt on her two sisters, mischievous
Abigail and gentle little Dorothy, who were
sleeping warmly in their feather bed. The
world was a-quiver with life and sound. Mary
Jane looked anxiously through the small-paned
window. Surely, Providence would grant a
pleasant day for the last of the housecleaning!
Her mother was ill with the new baby brother
and the kitchen must be cleaned before she was
about again. It was not easy to do the work
as well as her mother would have done it, but a
bright, sunshiny day would help.</p>
<p>The sun was just rising and a cool, northwest
breeze was blowing the mist from the pond and
gully. The sunlight sparkled on the pond
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
which lay across the foot of the field and the
breeze blew it into dark blue ripples. Mary
Jane dreamed a minute. John Lewis must be
in port, she thought, and perhaps he would be
home to-day. His father&rsquo;s whaler, the <i>Breezy
Belle</i>, had reached Gloucester the first of the
week. If she planned well and hurried the
work she might be able to go down to Jenny
Lewis&rsquo;s in the afternoon to see her new dresses.
Jenny Lewis was John&rsquo;s sister, and she had
more pretty clothes than any girl in town. It
would be a welcome change to visit her before
supper. The past week of housecleaning had
been a busy one, for the girls had cleaned the
dooryard and the entry as well as the back
room and the loft bedroom. Their mother, before
her illness, had cleaned and aired her best
front room and put back in their places the
few pieces of furniture which stood in this cold
and little-used room.</p>
<p>The well-sweep creaked in the breeze, and a
whiff of the smoke of the kitchen fire, pouring
out of the chimney, blew up the stairway. Mary
Jane straightened her simple gray dress, folding
a fresh white kerchief across her breast.
The neighbors called her smart and comely.
She was sixteen, and tall and strong, the oldest
of eight children. Her brothers and sisters
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
knew her to be gentle as well as firm and just.
They never shirked Mary Jane&rsquo;s orders, but
they carried to her their bruised toes and cut
fingers, the stitches dropped in their knitting,
the knots tied in their patchwork. She bound
up their hurts and set them to work again.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;Daughter,&rdquo; called her father from the foot
of the stairs, &ldquo;the day comes on apace, and it
promises a clear sky for your cleaning. Grandmother
is tending your mother and the new
babe, but John and I will need the porridge hot
when we come back from foddering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Jane answered her father gravely and
picked up the candle to take with her to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
kitchen. She called the older of her sisters.
The three all slept in the low-ceilinged upstairs
chamber. &ldquo;Come Abigail! You are in
truth a sleepyhead. Come! Everything&rsquo;s
awake, and we have much to do! Father has
called and indeed you must hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="512" />
<p class="pcap"><a href="#rfig2"><span class="sc">Figure 2.</span> <span class="sc">Candlesticks</span></a></p>
</div>
<p>In the kitchen a glowing bed of red-hot coals
burned on the hearth, streaks of sunlight
glanced through the eastern windows and
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
touched the snowy, coarse cloth on the large
dinner-table. Soft reflections shone from the
pewter porringers hanging on the dresser; a
sunbeam flecked with bright light the brass
candlestick which Mary Jane set near its mate
on the mantel over the hearth. In the south
windows red geraniums blossomed and there
was an atmosphere of homely cheer and comfort
in the room. All winter, the family had
gathered in the kitchen and, in its warm cosiness,
Mary Jane had spun, darned mittens and
knit stockings. She loved the kitchen, and she
worked there happily and energetically, putting
into her tasks that same heartfelt devotion to
duty that her great-grandfather had brought
across the sea to the Massachusetts colony more
than a hundred years before.</p>
<p>Her mother called quietly from the nearby
bedroom, and Mary Jane tiptoed in. The
baby was asleep and the sight of him in his
helplessness and of her mother, always so
strong and active, lying now so quiet and helpless
at the beginning of a busy day, stirred her
strangely. She bent awkwardly and kissed
them, and blushed as she straightened up.
Kisses were rare in her home, and she was surprised
at herself. Her grandmother came in,
and a commotion from the kitchen warned her
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
that the boys were awake. Her three younger
brothers, steady Thomas, and the twins, Asa
and George, slept in the turn-down bed in the
corner of the kitchen. They tumbled out and
helped and punched each other into their
clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No shoes and stockings to-day, boys,&rdquo;
Mary Jane called. &ldquo;Housecleaning time, and
shoes have barely lasted through the frost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going to the table in the corner, she poured
water into the wash basin. She washed her
face and hands in the cold water, newly drawn
from the well, gasping with the shock of its
coldness, and rubbed her face briskly with the
linen towel which hung over a roller on the
door.</p>
<p>Suddenly the back entry door swung open,
and roly-poly Sam Dodd came in, swinging an
iron pot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morrow, neighbors! Can you lend us
a coal? As the weather grows milder I fear we
tend our fire none too carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know John Lewis had come home?&rdquo;
he called to Mary Jane. &ldquo;Some of us stopped
to see him last night and Jenny came out and
two or three of the neighbors. Mother says
it is ungodly the way Cap&rsquo;n Lewis dresses
Jenny. &lsquo;Fine feathers don&rsquo;t make fine birds,&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
she says, and Jenny doesn&rsquo;t work enough to
pay the Cap&rsquo;n. She&rsquo;s a fair gad-about. He
toils mightily to get the whale oil to buy her
gowns. John seems real pleased to be home,
Mary Jane. He asked where you were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandmother came into the kitchen as Sam
started out with his borrowed fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray tell thy mother, Sam, that the candles
she helped us to make last fall are lasting well.
We have treasured the choice green bayberry
candles. Your mother will remember the day
she helped me pick the bayberries for them.
Now we do not need so much candle light, as
the days grow longer. Thank her kindly for
the bowl of rich soup she sent Daughter Andrews.
Daughter will soon be up and about.
Our new babe is six days old and strong and
lusty. Hear how he cries.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Sam grinned and bore off his coals fallen
from the burning sticks; while Grandmother
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
took the bowl of porridge in to her daughter.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">

</div>
<p>Drawing the settles up to the table Mary
Jane placed her father&rsquo;s chair at one end and
her mother&rsquo;s at the other for Grandmother.
Abigail and Dorothy seized the small brothers
and sisters and scrubbed them clean. Whereupon
the children took their porringers and
wooden bowls from the dresser and stood in
their places behind the settles. Abigail
strained into a pail the warm, frothy milk
which John, the oldest brother, had brought in,
and Dorothy filled the large pewter tankard
with cool milk from the cellar way. Mary Jane
bustled about. She dished up from the steaming
kettle on the hearth the corn meal mush, or
hasty pudding, and added a large, thin Johnny
cake, which she had browned in the skillet.
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
The children folded their hands and bowed their
heads. Grandmother had returned to the table.
Father leaned over the high back of his chair
and asked the Heavenly Father&rsquo;s blessing on
home and family and sought guidance in the
tasks of the day.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Mary Jane admired her father more than
anyone else in the world. Wasn&rsquo;t he always
right? She wondered. This morning while she
sat with bowed head she asked herself, wistfully,
if her father ever found it hard to decide between
pleasure and duty. What would he say
if he knew how much she wanted to see Jenny
Lewis&rsquo;s new clothes? Would he think her frivolous?
As she raised her eyes, she found her
father looking quietly at her. Somehow, she
seemed to feel as if he understood her better
than she did herself and she sat up straight and
proud because he was her father. She felt certain
that he would choose his duty however
hard he found it.</p>
<p>As Mary Jane ate her mush and milk, she
planned her day and thought occasionally of
Jenny Lewis. In Jenny&rsquo;s home they used a
tin kitchen, or roaster, for their goose. But
Mary Jane&rsquo;s family were poor, and they used
a home-made device for roasting their goose.
To a string hung in the fireplace Mary Jane
would tie the goose&rsquo;s leg and Asa would sit
in front of the fire and twist the string, so that
the goose might become evenly browned.
Jenny&rsquo;s mother used a plate-warmer, made with
one side open to the heat, but Mary Jane would
dip her plates into a kettle of hot water and
never envy her friends their extra comforts and
luxuries. However, Mary Jane <i>did</i> have a
lively interest in new things and pretty clothes,
and she said to herself that she would get
through her work and have an hour or two before
supper to visit Jenny whether or no.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Her father had set the churn near the hearth
and the cream was warm enough for Thomas to
beat. The brick oven was well heated, and she
could bake apple pies, using the last of the
dried apples. George should take down the
few strings of apples which were left hanging
on the kitchen rafters, and Dorothy should
wash them at the well. It would not take long
for Dorothy to clear away the dishes and fold
the table-cloth and napkins. The family had
few dishes and most of these were pewter bowls
and porringers. A few blue dishes of Grandmother&rsquo;s,
that she had brought from England,
were left. These were used only on rare occasions.
Mary Jane would wash them herself.
The silver spoons and Mother&rsquo;s white-handled
knives must be scoured with care. Abigail
should attend to them and the pewter and the
tin-lined copper kettles. Abigail liked to make
them shine and Mary Jane knew that when one&rsquo;s
heart is in a task the work goes quickly. There
was always wool to card, and the small boys
might do this in odd moments. When the fireplace
was cleaned out, one of the boys must
empty all the ashes into the leach barrel.
Through the winter the family had saved the
ashes and all grease from cooking and butchering
and, in the fall, Mother would make soft
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
soap. Mary Jane&rsquo;s mother and grandmother
always had good luck with their soft soap, and
in the clear jelly-like substance there remained
little trace of the rancid grease and strong lye
from which it had been made.</p>
<p>The simple but nourishing breakfast was
soon over. Father spoke occasionally to John
about the work of the day. &ldquo;The flax patch
must be harrowed and sowed and the sods
turned for the corn,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a likely drying day, John; the wind
and sun will draw the dampness from the earth,
and take the dust from your rugs, too, Daughter,&rdquo;
he added, as he rose and picked up his
broad, soft hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, children, that your mother has
taught you to work quickly and with care.
Show that you have learned your lesson well.
Boys, stand ready to handle the dasher, or
turn the roast. Come, John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breakfast finished, all became bustle and stir.
Grandmother slipped briskly to her large, wool
spinning-wheel. She was white-haired and full
of years, but still she plied her task of spinning
energetically and skilfully. She had learned it
long before in a shire of England where wool
was raised and made into cloth. Grandmother
was graceful and dignified in carriage; for
many years of her life she had walked back
and forth at her wheel, lightly poised and alert.
She lifted her spinning-wheel, and, with awkward
help from Thomas, carried it into Mother
Andrew&rsquo;s room.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must needs be out of thy way, Mary Jane,
and will spin in thy mother&rsquo;s room to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Grandmother soon returned, holding the
baby in the crook of her left arm. She seated
herself near the fire and unwrapped many
layers of soft woolen covers from little Samuel.
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
Dipping her elbow into the basin of warm
water at her side, she found it just right and
bathed the baby quickly, wrapped him again in
the folds of the flannel, and retied his little cap.
She then put him in the cradle, and called
Thomas to rock him to sleep.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">

<p class="pcap"><a href="#rfig8"><span class="sc">Figure 8.</span> <span class="sc">A Cradle</span></a></p>
</div>
<p>Mary Jane told her brothers and sisters
what she expected of each of them before she
pulled out her rolling-board and started to
make pie-crust.</p>
<p>Abigail banged the churn dasher up and
down and thought eagerly of the pewter and
brasses to be polished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thomas, methinks the wee child must be
asleep. Stretch up to this churn dasher and
prove yourself a dashing knave,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Abigail, teach not to children such play on
words,&rdquo; chided Mary Jane.</p>
<p>Abigail frowned and said, &ldquo;You were not
always so proper in your speech, Mary Jane,
before John Lewis came a-courting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Jane, flushed and flustered, knocked
her cap awry, and accidentally wiped a floury
hand across her cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose that I shall be thus improved
when someone comes a-courting me?&rdquo;
Abigail went on. &ldquo;What do you think John
Lewis may have made you? He has had time
enough for many a turn of the hand. It is
full three months since the whaler put out from
Gloucester. Do you think that even a slow-witted
fellow like your John may have speed
in his fingers? Perchance he whittles faster
than he talks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abigail,&rdquo; Mary Jane interrupted, &ldquo;the butter
must have come. Run out to the well for
fresh water. I will gather the butter while you
are gone. Curb your saucy tongue, sister.
Mistress Dodd is coming up the road with her
pot of beans, and I would not have her hear
your foolish gossip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John wants the flint-lock, Mary Jane. Pass
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
it down to me quickly. Oh hurry, kindly,&rdquo;
Abigail called as she tumbled in at the doorway.
The little boys followed close at her heels. &ldquo;The
dog has dug out a woodchuck in the stone wall,
near the flax patch, and John thinks he can pot
him. Do hasten, Mary Jane! Your fingers
were not always thumbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gun was loaded, for when it was wanted
it was wanted quickly, and loading was no quick
matter. Throwing it over her shoulder as John
would have done, Abigail ran from the house.</p>
<p>Dorothy could not bear to have killed even
a woodchuck who ate the flax plants. Mary
Jane knew how the child loved all dumb creatures,
and she sent her out into the south door-yard,
patchwork in hand. Dorothy sat down
on the door-step and sewed. She was setting
patchwork blocks for Mary Jane&rsquo;s new quilt.
It was a &ldquo;Job&rsquo;s Trouble&rdquo; pattern and there
were in it many hexagonal blocks of real India
chintz, and French calicoes that Jenny Lewis
had given Mary Jane. Dorothy sewed over
and over with painstakingly small stitches.
But the spring day enticed her, and she stole
away from her stint. She poked with a stick
among the roots and dried leaves in the garden
border, and thought eagerly of the colors and
sweet odors soon to awaken there: hollyhocks
and purple stocks, candytuft and pinks, Sweet
William, by the door-step, and love-lies-a-bleeding,
Queen Margarets, larkspur, tiger lilies and
bouncing-bet, and sunflowers to be planted here
and there with corn. Dorothy played only a
few minutes, for conscience urged her to pick
up the unfinished square of patchwork, and she
soon went back into the house. Mary Jane
bade her show Mistress Dodd into their
mother&rsquo;s room, for her own arms were deep in
the butter-bowl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>After Abigail had helped dig out the woodchuck,
she brought in the two pails of clear
rinsing water for the butter, and hastened to
start her own task of the day. The pewter
and copper should be made to shine as never
before. She arranged on the far end of the
dinner-table, pewter porringers, solid silver
spoons, the pewter tankard and one large pewter
plate and several small ones, the long-handled
brass warming pan, two tall brass candlesticks
and the snuffers from the mantel. She
even removed the flint-lock pistols from their
holsters beneath the mantel. Their brass
mountings were dull and lustreless. She looked
longingly at the brass clasps of Father&rsquo;s large
Bible. When Mary Jane was elsewhere it
might be possible to make them shine as they
should.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have a lively way, Abigail, when your
interest is taken. If we hasten, we may have
the kitchen ordered by dinner-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; Abigail exclaimed.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">

<p class="pcap"><a href="#rfig12"><span class="sc">Figure 12.</span> <span class="sc">Snuffers</span></a></p>
</div>
<p>Mary Jane looked up in consternation. Her
father was bringing in two men; one was the
minister and the other a stranger. She could
hear them wiping their boots on the old rug
on the porch. Abigail sprang helpfully forward
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
to gather up and conceal her cleaning
rags, and in doing so overturned the churn,
half full of buttermilk! Mary Jane heard the
crash, and saw the door open. Her father
stepped right into the rushing stream of buttermilk
before he saw there was an accident,
and Mary Jane wondered stupidly why she had
never noticed before how much the floor sloped
toward the entry. The buttermilk ran over her
father&rsquo;s shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a sad state of affairs, Daughter,&rdquo;
her father said with grave reproof, &ldquo;but we
will go around by the other door. The minister
has called to see your mother, and this
good man, the indigo peddler, needs some
breakfast. He has traveled far this morning.
Attend to his needs and I doubt not he will
show his gratitude in some way that will help
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Jane looked ruefully at the confusion,
but gratefully to her father for his forbearance.
Abigail had meant well, and accidents would
happen. Even if it was housecleaning time, the
peddler must be fed. Father believed that all
hungry people should be treated kindly. &ldquo;Better
to feed a dozen ungracious ones,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;than to turn away one deserving and needy.&rdquo;
Mary Jane directed Abigail to bring out cold
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
porridge and salt fish and milk for the peddler,
while she mopped up the floor.</p>
<p>As Mistress Dodd finished her call and came
out of their mother&rsquo;s room, Mary Jane looked
up from the floor and asked her if she would
not take home a pat of new butter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twill not come amiss with hot Johnny
cake, Mistress Dodd,&rdquo; she said, as she went on
with her mopping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, I will be glad to have it, Mary
Jane, and thank you, too. What a bother to
lose the good buttermilk,&rdquo; she added, looking
at the floor. Then she slyly pinched Mary
Jane&rsquo;s white arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Lewis came home last night, and they
say he looks fine and hearty, Mary Jane. Think
you he has learned to talk and ask questions?
Have you an answer ready for him? Do not
turn away your head, child, I mean naught by
these bantering words. Later, I will send Sam
for our baked beans. Thank you for letting
us use your oven. Good-day, all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Jane finished cleaning up the floor and
scattered the children who had gathered in the
kitchen. Strangers were an event, and the
young ones looked at the peddler eagerly and
intently. The old man sat down and drew
toward him the bowl of porridge, first taking a
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
long draught of the buttermilk near at hand.
Looking up from her task, Mary Jane reproved
Dorothy for staring.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">

<p class="pcap"><a href="#rfig13"><span class="sc">Figure 13.</span> <span class="sc">Reel for Winding Thread</span></a></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take this flagon of buttermilk up to the
flax patch. We saved this much in the churn.
&rsquo;Tis ten o&rsquo;clock and Father and John must be
hungry. The drink will help them through
the next hour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Turning to Abigail, she suggested that she
put out of doors the rocking-chair and small
table. The Bible and work-basket and
mother&rsquo;s reel might go into mother&rsquo;s room.
Perhaps the peddler would help her move the
settles out on the grass. Mary Jane herself
knelt down on the hearth to take up the ashes.</p>
<p>The peddler jumped up. &ldquo;Willing hands
make light work, Mistress Mary, and out
go the tables and the chairs. Back again!
and now, my dears, we are ready for the old
settles. Came from the sturdy land of England,
these did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Jane frowned and settled her cap with
dignity. &ldquo;I like not too much talk. If we
save our breath it will help in the lifting.
Be careful of the door, please, I would not have
the wood scarred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear the ways, my hearties,&rdquo; the peddler
called, not seeming to be disturbed by Mary
Jane&rsquo;s dignified words, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the man for that
job. Up you get, Mistress Mary, and down
goes Jake, the indigo peddler. I can holystone
a deck, why not brush up the ashes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Jane looked doubtfully at her helper,
but she soon admitted that he used the shovel
and the turkey wing with a neat hand. Father
said that it was often more generous to accept
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
help than to give it, and so thinking, she turned
to other work.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/p14.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="602" />
<p class="pcap"><a href="#rfig14"><span class="sc">Figure 14.</span> <span class="sc">Kettle</span></a></p>
</div>
<p>Directing Dorothy to take one kettle and
Abigail the other, Mary Jane started them to
cleaning the woodwork. There was plenty of
hot water in the big pot which had been hanging
on the crane, and there were soft soap and
stout cloths. The girls were careful not to
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
waste the soap, but they hunted for every speck
and streak of dirt. Having answered a call
from her mother, Mary Jane came back to the
kitchen, bright-eyed, but demure. Mother
had said that she wished Abigail to wash up
the bricks in the fireplace, and Mary Jane
would clean the windows. Master Jake had
helped them generously, but they could finish
up the rest of the work alone, their mother
thought.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">

<p class="pcap"><a href="#rfig15"><span class="sc">Figure 15.</span> <span class="sc">Swinging Crane</span></a></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just as the Mistress says. I&rsquo;ll be off. Indigo
has gone a-begging this morning, but perhaps
I can sell some cochineal up the road.
Good-day and the Lord bless ye!&rdquo; So saying
the old man bent to his pack and trudged away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Abigail stood and pondered. She was mischievously
interested in the change of plan.
Mary Jane generally washed out the fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it mean, Dorothy? Dost think
John Lewis would notice if Mary Jane&rsquo;s hands
were smutted and grimy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Methinks &rsquo;tis best for us to stop talking
and get to our work. Mother would have Mary
Jane make a good impression. Mary Jane is
comely, and John Lewis is not a-courting <i>us</i>.&rdquo;
Dorothy&rsquo;s reproof was gently made, and she
smiled at Abigail.</p>
<p>The three sisters worked steadily and swiftly.
Mary Jane appeared not to hear the whispering
of the younger girls. She polished the
windows, and the warm sunshine filled the
room. She soon relieved Dorothy of further
cleaning, and sent her into the yard under the
hickory tree to sew a long seam. The child
fastened her work with a sewing-bird to a little
table, and sewed industriously.</p>
<p>John came in just then, and took down the
shoemaker&rsquo;s last. He wanted to get out an
ugly nail from his mother&rsquo;s shoe. She would
soon be up again. Mary Jane asked him if he
would take the children out to hunt for hens&rsquo;
nests after he had finished. She hoped to have
a custard for supper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<div class="img" id="fig16">

<p class="pcap"><a href="#rfig16"><span class="sc">Figure 16.</span> <span class="sc">Sewing-Bird</span></a></p>
</div>
<p>A little later her father followed John in
from the flax patch, and the family gathered
for dinner, eating cold boiled salmon and the
dried-apple pie which Mary Jane had hurriedly
made in the morning. These, with milk and
Johnny cake, soon satisfied the hungry workers
and each was back at his task.</p>
<p>Father and John predicted a thunder-shower
in the late afternoon, and Mary Jane
looked anxiously at the clouds. Perhaps the
shower would go round? She was not much
tired, she thought, and the work, in spite of
accidents, was going well. It would be too
hard if she finished the kitchen in time and
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
then had to give up her visit to Jenny because
of a thunder-shower. But after dinner the
work went more slowly. It seemed as if she
could not get things all finished and the kitchen
looking just right. She was more tired than
she had realized. But her determination to
get away for a little time before supper grew
with her weariness. She worked desperately to
put the finishing touches on the room, and,
after a while, it suited her.</p>
<p>Abigail and Dorothy had gone out with John
and the little boys to hunt for eggs, before they
washed and changed their dresses. Mary
Jane&rsquo;s mother and the little baby brother were
sleeping and her grandmother&rsquo;s spinning-wheel
made the only sound in the afternoon&rsquo;s stillness.
The room darkened with the coming storm. The
leaves of the red geraniums moved in the rising
wind, and the white, sash curtains blew out into
the room. Mary Jane picked a dried leaf out
of the basket of freshly laundered caps and
straightened the blue calico cushion in the rocking
chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<div class="img" id="fig17">

<p class="pcap"><a href="#rfig17"><span class="sc">Figure 17.</span> <span class="sc">Andirons or Fire-Dogs</span></a></p>
</div>
<p>She opened the door of the brick
oven where Mrs. Dodd&rsquo;s beans and their own
had been baking since morning. The beans were
baked perfectly in the round, brown pots, and
their fragrant, appetizing odor filled the room.
Looking about, before she went upstairs, Mary
Jane felt that her mother would be satisfied
with the appearance of the kitchen. The brass
andirons in the fireplace and the shovel and
tongs glowed from Abigail&rsquo;s honest rubbing.
The black pots and copper kettles had been
cleaned inside and out and hooked on to the
swinging frame. The waffle-irons and toaster
hung on the side of the fireplace and the gridiron
stood on its three slender legs beside the
hearth.</p>

</div>
<p>A small fire burned red on the hearth
and a gentle cloud of steam rose from the bubbling
kettle. The brass warming-pan made a
blob of light against the dull red bricks. The
dresser was white from its recent scrubbing
and the pewter on it shone brightly. Grandmother&rsquo;s
blue plates and saucers had been rearranged
on the plate rail and the spoons and
white-handled knives laid back in the mahogany
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
boxes on the dresser. John had whittled and
smoothed those boxes for his mother in the
winter evenings. The Bible, and the New England
Primer and Father&rsquo;s horned spectacles lay
on the small table in the corner, and the cradle,
with its new pink and white checked cover, stood
near the fireplace. When Mother got up, the
baby would lie in that all day. The floor looked
nice and clean. It had been freshly sanded and
the braided rugs laid carefully in their usual
places before the hearth and doorways. The old
gray cat had stretched himself near the fireplace,
and his friend, the dog, slept beside him.</p>
<p>Mary Jane noticed that the wind had blown
awry Dorothy&rsquo;s framed sampler which hung on
the wall. She straightened it and read again
the words: &ldquo;Honor thy father and thy mother
that thy days may be long in the land which
the Lord thy God giveth thee. Dorothy Ward
Andrews.&rdquo; She read the words soberly, and
thought of her own good father. Picking up
her clean cap and a basin of water, she started
upstairs. A sudden clap of thunder shook the
house and, with the first sprinkle of rain, the
kitchen door blew open and Jenny Lewis
dashed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just in time, Mary Jane! I am glad you
are through with your work! I have come to
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
take you home to supper as soon as this shower
blows over. John told me to tell you he would
bring you home this evening. He has something
pretty for you. I do not know what it is, but
he made it and he feels sure that you will like
it. You are too good, Mary Jane! I told
John that you were kinder than I, but perhaps
you would not like his homemade gift. I am
very sure that I should not prefer it unless it
were finer than you could buy in the shops.&rdquo; So
talking on, Jenny pushed Mary Jane through
the stairway door.</p>
<p>The storm drove her father out of the flax
patch, and in a few minutes, he hastened into
the warmth of the kitchen. His wife called from
the inner room and told him that Jenny Lewis
had come for Mary Jane and she hoped he
would allow the girl to go down to Cap&rsquo;n Lewis&rsquo;s
for the evening. There could be no harm,
the mother said, in Mary Jane having well-to-do
friends. John Lewis was a sober, industrious
youth, even though his sister Jenny was
rather flighty. She would like to have Mary
Jane go more often to visit in Jenny&rsquo;s home.
As the mother made her ambitious little plans,
the girls came into the kitchen. Mary Jane
glanced shyly at her father. She was wearing
her best summer dress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny has asked me down to her house for
supper, Father. The storm has passed around,
and the sun is coming out. I should like to go.
Everything is ready to put on the table for
your supper, and Abigail can attend to the
children. Jenny says she and John will walk
a piece with me when I come home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mary Jane Andrews, I never said
anything of the sort!&rdquo; Jenny exclaimed, &ldquo;John
sent word he wanted to bring you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Jane&rsquo;s father looked at her searchingly
and gravely. Mary Jane had not meant
to tell a fib but she was always bashful when
she spoke of John Lewis. Could there be a
smile in her father&rsquo;s eye? She thought not.
She dropped her own eyes and waited. In a
minute her father spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not go out to-night, Daughter. Your
mother will be up in a day or two, and then
there will be more freedom for you. Responsibility
will not hurt any lass and a small disappointment
is better than a pleasure taken at
the wrong time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell John,&rdquo; her father added as he turned
to Jenny, &ldquo;that we shall be glad to see him
when he calls up here. I hear that your father
has made another successful trip. It is a hard
and dangerous life he lives on the sea. May
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
the Lord prosper him.&rdquo; Then Mary Jane&rsquo;s
father went out.</p>
<p>Jenny flung herself into the rocker and spoke
angrily to Mary Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad indeed that my father is not a
cross-patch! What does your father think?
Just because he is one of the elders in the
church must his daughter have no pleasure?
He does not give you any gay dresses. Even
your best dress is just this blue one with a
white kerchief. It is not fair, and now he will
spoil our little pleasure. I believe he likes to
forbid you to do things, just because he knows
you will obey. Why do you? Come with me
and show your father you have a right to a few
minutes in the day! Perhaps he does not approve
of me! Well, I do not care. Come,
Mary Jane. Come down and see my new
dresses. Your father said, &lsquo;Better not go out
to-night&rsquo;; he did not forbid you to go. You
can tell him that when you come back. Oh,
what is the use of coaxing! You look just as
stubborn as your father. Good-by, I am going
home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back here, Jenny Lewis!&rdquo; Mary Jane
called after her. &ldquo;I am glad I look like my
father! He has a perfect right to keep me at
home if he wants to. Folks feel sorry because
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
your father has to work so hard and spend so
much of his money on clothes for you. I like
pretty clothes too, but if my father thinks I
am putting too much thought on myself, he
tells me so. He shows me my duty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig22">

<p class="pcap"><a href="#rfig22"><span class="sc">Figure 22.</span> <span class="sc">Wheel for Spinning Flax</span></a></p>
</div>
<p>Mary Jane pulled her flax-wheel toward her
and whirled the wheel rapidly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;My father believes I will grow in grace and
patience for big sorrows and disappointments
if I bear little ones cheerfully. What kind of
practice are you getting, Jenny Lewis? It is
wicked to talk about a father as you have
talked about mine. I am not disappointed one
bit about not going to your house. I like my
homespun dresses and I can make linen as fine
as you get in your dresses from England. When
I get the kitchen cleaned and the floor sanded
and the white curtains in place I feel happy.
It is my work and it pleases my mother and I
like to do it. Father does not say much about
our work, because he expects us to do it well.
He knows work is good for us. But what are
you doing, Jenny? All you think about is
pretty dresses and looking gay. I am glad
Father thought I was needed here at suppertime&mdash;but
I will come down to your
house some other night,&rdquo; Mary Jane said more
gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are right, Mary Jane, but
you need not get so cross about it. I may be
lazy, I suppose, but I do not see what there is
about work that makes you like to do it, and
in disappointment, even a little one, that makes
you glad to bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny, I cannot explain. I like to cook
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
and clean and spin and knit. That&rsquo;s the way I
feel. It isn&rsquo;t hard. I don&rsquo;t mean to be conceited
or think myself better than other people,
but somehow when my father is strictest with
me something inside of me likes it. Here comes
Dorothy with a bunch of pink and white arbutus.
It grows late up in the woods. How
pretty it is! Our Pilgrim grandmothers must
have been glad to see it peeping up from the
snow after their long, hard winters. Who is
this coming in with the boys? Why, it is your
brother John! Jenny, will you and John stay
to supper with us?&rdquo; Mary Jane turned to her
friend eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mary Jane, and I will help you with
the dishes and, after supper, John shall tell us
stories about his voyage. It is just as well we
were disappointed! I will try to be a more
dutiful daughter, Mary Jane. I guess Father
and Mother like to have me visit you. They
chide me for my heedless ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls and boys came trooping in together
and Mary Jane pushed aside her flax-wheel
and stirred the embers on the hearth,
laying on fresh sticks. John Lewis met her
with awkward shyness and dropping a bulky
package on the chair beside her said, &ldquo;Open
it later, Mary Jane. It is for you. I whittled
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
it out in spare minutes aboard the <i>Breezy
Belle</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny called across the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, John Lewis, and all of you boys
wash while we help Mary Jane dish up the
beans. It is supper time, and she has asked
you and me to stay. Here is Sam Dodd, Mary
Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, he wants his mother&rsquo;s beans. They
are the ones in the back of the oven, Jenny.
Please help him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be glad to help you while your
oven is being repaired, Sam. Tell your mother
to send in anything she wants to have baked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do open the door for him, John. It would
be a pity for him to drop the beans and spoil
his mother&rsquo;s supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, laughing and hurrying, Mary Jane and
her helpers soon had on the table their supper
of baked beans and brown bread, custards and
cool drinks of milk. After supper, Father
asked his family and the company to gather
for prayers at once for he had an errand up the
road and wished to get back early. The planting
and housecleaning days were hard ones and
he knew that his folks needed to get to bed in
good season if they wanted to do good work
the following day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<div class="img" id="fig23">

<p class="pcap"><a href="#rfig23"><span class="sc">Figure 23.</span> <span class="sc">Powder-Horn</span></a></p>
</div>
<p>Mary Jane placed a candle on the table near
the Bible and the children drew up their stools
and Father&rsquo;s chair. Father read the twenty-third
psalm and knelt to pray. He thanked
the Lord for the blessings of the day, the fair
weather and plentiful food and his helpful
sons and daughters. He prayed that all young
souls, untried in the furnace of life, should lean
on the Lord and strive to do their duty nobly
as He would show it to them. He prayed
earnestly and rose from his knees weary but
heartened. The young folks went gravely
about the task of clearing away the dishes. But
when Father Andrews departed, their solemnity
gave place to mirth and jolly fun. John raked
open the coals and brought out a little popcorn
that had lasted through the winter.
Thomas agreed to pop it for them, and John
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
took down his powder-horn. He wanted to
finish whittling the design on it. Dorothy
coaxed Jenny down on the settle to tell about
her visit in Boston and Mary Jane brought out
a skein of soft, white wool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will hold this for me, John
Lewis? I am going to knit a hood for the
new babe Samuel, but the wool must first be
wound in a ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mary Jane, there is a better way to
hold that worsted than on a man&rsquo;s outstretched
arms. Open the package I brought you and
look within.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Jane untied the hempen cord fastened
about the bundle John had brought in and the
boys and girls gathered near, with jest and
laughing glances. So John Lewis had made
their sister something! Well, he always looked
as if he liked her, but this was proof indeed.
What could it be, so bulky and strange looking?
Would Mary Jane never get it out? She
handled the string slowly (almost lovingly,
John Lewis hoped). But at last the covers fell
off on her lap, and she held out a dainty and
beautifully polished swift. John took it from
her, and, placing it on the table, dropped over
the outspread spokes, her skein of white
worsted. He quickly found the end of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
skein, and placing it gently in Mary Jane&rsquo;s
hand, bade her wind the ball. As the reel turned
slowly and Mary Jane&rsquo;s ball grew large and
soft, she lifted her eyes gratefully to John
Lewis. The others had withdrawn to the settles
and fireplace and John made bold to whisper
as he leaned across the corner of the table:</p>
<div class="img" id="fig24">
<img src="images/p22.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="553" />
<p class="pcap"><a href="#rfig24"><span class="sc">Figure 24.</span> <span class="sc">Swift for Winding Yarn</span></a></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Jane, will you walk out with me on
the Sabbath? &rsquo;Twill be a long six months before
we put to sea again, and, perhaps, in that
time you may come to like a slow fellow like me.
Maybe I can make you a chest to put your caps
and linens in while I am home. That would
make you think of me when you put things in
it after I am gone. Will you walk with me,
Mary Jane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Jane twirled the reel and examined the
cunningly wrought initials of her name on the
side and flushed a lovely color when she discovered
J. L.&mdash;John Lewis&mdash;just below
them. She gazed laughingly at John and
nodded her head, but her shy whisper left him
speechless:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think you are a slow fellow, John,
and I like you now. I have liked you a long
time! I have a chest and it is half full of fine
linen. I have been busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Jane, did you think of me as you
spun the linen and dyed the wool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Jane nodded again and picked up her
knitting-needles. Her father came in and John
jumped to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder Andrews, may I have Mary Jane for
my wife? She likes me, she says, and we need
not wait? Will you let us have the banns published
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
this Sabbath approaching? I am twenty,
sir, and Mary Jane is sixteen. That is only
a year younger than my father and mother
were when they married and came to the
colony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daughter, is this your wish?&rdquo; her father
asked.</p>
<p>A solemn hush fell on the group in the
kitchen. Grandmother stood in the doorway and
gazed affectionately on the oldest daughter of
their family. She knew the sterling worth of
the girl John Lewis desired for his wife, and
she knew that if these young people married,
another home would be established in the colony
which would be a power for righteousness
and godly living.</p>
<p>Mary Jane looked steadfastly at her father,
and tucked her hand under John&rsquo;s arm as she
answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then God bless you both, my children, and
may you believe all that is required in this
world is for you to live justly, to love mercy
and to walk humbly with your God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he walked quietly from the room.
The brothers and sisters crowded about Mary
Jane and John, and Jenny whispered as she put
on her bonnet: &ldquo;Mary Jane, I like your father.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Mary Jane smiled gently. A peace and happiness
had come into her heart that knew no
words. She turned to John to say good-night.
Her father&rsquo;s blessing shone from her loyal,
brave eyes, and John Lewis knew that he was
truly fortunate among men.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">HOW TO BUILD A COLONIAL KITCHEN</span>
<br /><span class="smaller">IN SCHOOL, LIBRARY OR MUSEUM</span></h2>
<p>Give to an intelligent carpenter the
following directions:</p>
<p>Make the kitchen, if possible, as
large as 16&prime; &times; 20&prime;. Put the fireplace
in the center of one of the longer sides. On
the opposite side make the wall the height of
an ordinary table, 31&Prime;, except for a space of 3&prime;
at each end, thus leaving an opening on that
side about 14 feet long. Through this opening
the kitchen will be chiefly viewed. At the right
of the opening put a door, cut in half in the
old Dutch fashion. (<a href="#pl1">Plate I</a>.)</p>
<p>Build the walls of &ldquo;compo-board,&rdquo; a trade
article easily obtained, and costing (January,
1921) about 8 cents per square foot. We
have found nothing so serviceable as this for
light and temporary interior construction.
Make the walls not over 8&prime; high. Construct
rafters of thin boards&mdash;they may even be of
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
compo-board and hollow, and lay them across
from wall to wall. (<a href="#pl2">Plate II</a>.)</p>
<p>At one end put 2 or 3 windows. These windows
should be small and have small panes. The
sash need not be movable. The windows in
the picture were found at a junk shop, as
were also the door already mentioned and the
one for the corner cupboard. (<a href="#pl3">Plate III</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="#pl2">Plate II</a> shows the character of the fireplace
and its size, and gives the mantel-piece
in ample detail. The bricks are, of course, only
such in appearance, being painted on. The
crane may be a genuine old one, or of wood.
The fire is made by an electric lamp, hidden in
the sticks and covered with red tissue.</p>
<p>The wainscoting and the mantel-piece are
simple in the extreme. The appearance of paneling
is produced by tacking molding on the
walls of compo-board, all as indicated. The
ceiling is made of cotton cloth stretched tightly
above the beams.</p>
<p>In one corner is a cupboard. This can be
made, as in the picture, with an ordinary small
door, or can be a genuine antique. On the walls
may be hung a hood, tippets, mittens and a few
other domestic articles, all as indicated. Above
are peppers, a few strings of dried apples, etc.
But be chary of objects and keep the whole
atmosphere simple. (<a href="#pl4">Plate IV</a>.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Paint rafters, wainscoting and cornice all
the same color, as suits the taste of the constructor.
The walls above the wainscoting
should be very near white for lighting purposes.</p>
<p>Outside so place bushes like barberries that
they may be seen through the windows. (<a href="#pl3">Plate III</a>.)</p>
<p>We found it desirable to have the kitchen
lighted from one end. Thus lighted it looked
much like a genuine interior at sunset. To get
this illumination through the windows at one
end, we first reduced the general lighting of the
room in which the kitchen was erected. We
then placed, a few feet from the windows, a
large screen of cotton cloth on which were
sketched in strong color a tree against a brilliant
yellow sunset sky. Right under the windows
we placed several strong electric lights
with reflectors, throwing a brilliant light upon
the screen above mentioned. From the screen,
as if from a sunset, there came a yellow light
into the room, adding greatly to the beauty
and attractiveness of the whole interior.</p>
<p>The furnishings of the room will depend on
what may be found available for the purpose.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">APPENDIX</span></h2>
<h3 id="c6"><a href="#fig1" id="rfig1">FIGURE 1</a></h3>
<p>Well and well-sweep. Water was rarely
piped into houses and barns. Lacking a brook
or spring a well was dug near the house.
Pumps were expensive and not often used, but
a device like this for lifting water from a well
could easily be made. The pole, or sweep, was
so weighted at the large end that it would
almost lift the vertical stick and the bucket at
the other end when the latter was full of water.
A moderate pull on the vertical pole carried
the bucket down to the water. When the
bucket had filled a moderate lift on the pole
brought it to the top. A chain from A to B
gave room to lift the bucket over the curb.</p>
<h3 id="c7"><a href="#fig2" id="rfig2">FIGURE 2</a></h3>
<p>Candlesticks were often of brass, though
the poorer people used those made of wood, iron
or tin; and three nails driven into a bit of board
could serve very well. Those of brass were
often beautiful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>The knob on the upright of the stick at the
left slid up and down in a slot and carried with
it a movable base; with this device the candle
was lifted out of the upright as it burned, until
the base came to the top and the last atom of
the candle burned.</p>
<p>The central stick shows a like device, and has
also a thin projecting arm of brass which could
be put into a socket in the wall.</p>
<p>The third one has its candle covered by an
extinguisher, a hollow cone, dropped on a
lighted candle to put it out. The upstanding
extension of brass has a hole in its end, and by
this can be hung over a nail in the wall.</p>
<h3 id="c8"><a href="#fig3" id="rfig3">FIGURE 3</a></h3>
<p>A porringer or shallow bowl, often of pewter
and sometimes of silver, with a handle which
was commonly decorated with perforations.
The perforations helped to keep the handle
cool. The porringer was chiefly used on the
table as a dish, though food was often cooked
in it also. It was most often used for serving
food to children.</p>
<h3 id="c9"><a href="#fig4" id="rfig4">FIGURE 4</a></h3>
<p>A cast-iron skillet with legs to lift it above
the coals and ashes. As all cooking vessels were
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
used at an open fire they were all made either
to hang above it like a pot or to stand before it
like a tin oven, or to rest upon its coals like a
three-legged skillet.</p>
<h3 id="c10"><a href="#fig5" id="rfig5">FIGURE 5</a></h3>
<p>A tin kitchen or roaster. A box of tin
standing on legs and with one side open. A
steel spit was stuck through the meat and the
meat was fastened to it by skewers, which
passed through the meat and through small
holes in the spit itself. All was then
placed in the roaster, which was set before
the fire. The spit was turned from time to
time as the cooking required. Gravy was
caught in the hollow below, and some of it was
now and then taken up in a spoon and poured
on the meat. This was &ldquo;basting.&rdquo; The task
of turning the spit by the crank on one end of
it was often given to a boy. In the homes of
the wealthy and in taverns the one who thus
minded the roast was often called a turn-spit.
By means of simple tread-mill devices a dog
was often used to turn the crank, and he then
became a turn-spit dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h3 id="c11"><a href="#fig6" id="rfig6">FIGURE 6</a></h3>
<p>A plate-warmer. This was a box of tin or
sheet iron on legs, with a door in one side. It
stood near the fire and in it were placed dishes
to be warmed, and food that was cooked and
ready to eat but needed to be kept hot until
the rest of the meal was prepared, or until all
the family had gathered and were ready to sit
down to the table. In very cold weather the
kitchen sometimes could not be kept warm, no
matter how big and hot the fire in the fireplace.
It was then a comfort, and almost a luxury,
to have hot dishes from which to eat the food
which the cold room soon chilled.</p>
<h3 id="c12"><a href="#fig7" id="rfig7">FIGURE 7</a></h3>
<p>A wool spinning-wheel. The spinner walked
back and forth in using this wheel, and her walk
was often many miles in a day&rsquo;s spinning. A
band of stout cord goes around the big wheel
and around the spindle. A strand of wool,
very light and loose, is gently drawn by hand
from the distaff to the end of the finished
thread which is wound about the spindle. This
strand is held loosely in the left hand. The
right hand on one of the spokes of the large
wheel gives it a smart turn. The spinner then
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
walks away from the machine and the spindle,
swiftly turned by the momentum of the large
wheel, twists the loose strand of wool into a
close thread. This thread is of such length and
of such size and hardness of twist as the spinner
decides upon, all being dependent on the force
with which the big wheel is pushed, on the
thickness of the loose strand of wool, and on
the way in which the spinner holds it as she
walks from the wheel. The finished thread is
then wound on the spindle by gently reversing
the large wheel, and holding the thread at the
spindle. Then the same process is repeated.</p>
<h3 id="c13"><a href="#fig8" id="rfig8">FIGURE 8</a></h3>
<p>A cradle. Few colonial babies had rocking
cradles as luxurious as this; indeed, few had
cradles at all.</p>
<h3 id="c14"><a href="#fig9" id="rfig9">FIGURE 9</a></h3>
<p>A wooden churn. Its like is used to this
day. In former times churning was one of the
tasks that many a farmer&rsquo;s boy had too much
of. On the lower end of the handle, which
passed down through a hole in the center of the
cover, was a disk of wood, perforated and
fitting loosely in the tall tub. The tub was
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
partially filled with cream and the butter was
made to &ldquo;come&rdquo; by moving the handle up
and down and thus splashing the disk up and
down in the cream.</p>
<h3 id="c15"><a href="#fig10" id="rfig10">FIGURE 10</a></h3>
<p>A flint-lock gun. The flint was fastened
into the hammer and, as it drove down against
a curved shield, it raised a shower of sparks
and at the same time lifted the shield and exposed
to the sparks the powder in the pan.
The powder, being thus ignited, the fire followed
it through the hole into the barrel and
exploded the powder in the &ldquo;charge&rdquo; behind the
bullet or shot. All flint-locks &ldquo;hung fire.&rdquo;
That is, the pulling of the trigger did not discharge
the gun as quickly as it does in modern
guns where the exploding cap is connected directly
with the charge in the cartridge.</p>
<p>A flint-lock pistol. This operated just as
did the flint-lock gun.</p>
<h3 id="c16"><a href="#fig11" id="rfig11">FIGURE 11</a></h3>
<p>The warming-pan. In most houses the only
warm place was by the kitchen fire. In winter
the bedrooms were about as cold as the weather
out of doors. This made the beds far from
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
comfortable to get into on a cold night. The
warming-pan was a basin of brass or copper
with a hinged cover, sometimes decorated. Hot
ashes and coals from the kitchen fire were put
into it; it was then carried to the bed and the
hot pan was pushed up and down between the
sheets until the whole bed was warm.</p>
<h3 id="c17"><a href="#fig12" id="rfig12">FIGURE 12</a></h3>
<p>Snuffers. Here, as in many of the other
pictures in this book, a tea-cup and saucer are
placed near the drawing of the object to be
described. This is added to give a correct
idea of the relative size of the objects represented.
In each case the object to be described
and the tea-cup are drawn to the same scale;
and, as you know about how large a tea-cup is,
you get a clear idea of the size of the object
by which it stands.</p>
<p>Snuffers were used to snip off the end of a
candle wick. As the tallow or wax melted and
burned, the top of the wick, although it was
burned to a mere black bit of coal, held fast to
the part of the wick which still continued to
draw up the melted tallow into the flame. If
this black end was not now and then picked off
with the snuffers, or some other instrument, or
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
with the fingers, it dropped over and perhaps
hit the top of the candle and kept it from burning
bright and clear.</p>
<p>The snuffers are like a pair of scissors, with
a box on one blade and a cover for the box on
the other. When used they were handled like
a pair of scissors and the black end of the wick
was snipped into the box out of sight and harm.
The pointed end of one blade was used to prick
up the wick if it did not stand straight or was
too tightly twisted. The three legs kept the
snuffers, which were sooty on the under side
from being stuck into the candle flame, away
from the table or the tray where they were
usually kept.</p>
<p>The candles of to-day do not often need to be
snuffed, because as their wicks, which are carefully
twisted, are burned free of the tallow, wax
or paraffin, they bend a little in the effort to
untwist. This bending thrusts the used-up end
sidewise into the hot, outer flame and there it
is quite burned up. In old days the wicks
were not twisted much, if at all, and so, as the
candle melted from them,&mdash;they stuck up into
the dull, smoky, non-burning part of the flame,
and stayed there until they hung over or fell off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h3 id="c18"><a href="#fig13" id="rfig13">FIGURE 13</a></h3>
<p>A reel for winding the thread into skeins,
from the spindle which was taken from the
spinning-wheel as soon as it was filled. By
means of a cog wheel and a worm screw within
the box, and a pointer on its side, the number
of turns of the reel were easily counted, and
that told the length of the thread wound on it.
As the wheel revolved it made a loud click for
each of a certain number of turns.</p>
<h3 id="c19"><a href="#fig14" id="rfig14">FIGURE 14</a></h3>
<p>Kettles were usually made of iron; these
had to be cast and not wrought, but, as they
were usually thick and heavy, most large kettles
were made of thin brass, sometimes of copper.
These tarnished easily and one of the
many and not very pleasant tasks of the housewife
was to keep them clean and bright.</p>
<h3 id="c20"><a href="#fig15" id="rfig15">FIGURE 15</a></h3>
<p>In the fireplace was hung a swinging crane
of iron. Suspended from it were hooks on
which pots and kettles were hung. The hooks
could be moved along the crane and were of
different lengths and sometimes adjustable. The
crane could thus hold several kettles at once,
some in the very heat of the fire and some
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
farther away. The fireplace was the center of
the home, the one source of heat, the one place
for cooking and often the one source of light
at night. Many pioneers and their families
had to do all their reading on long winter
evenings by the light of the open fire.</p>
<p>When a house was built and the chimney and
fireplace finished, the &ldquo;hanging of the crane,&rdquo;
the final step in preparation for housekeeping,
was sometimes part of a ceremony, with Bible
reading, hymns and prayers, followed by feasting
and rejoicing.</p>
<h3 id="c21"><a href="#fig16" id="rfig16">FIGURE 16</a></h3>
<p>All sewing was done by hand. A sewing-bird
was often fastened to a table by a thumbscrew.
The cloth was caught in the beak as
desired and this made the sewing easier.</p>
<h3 id="c22"><a href="#fig17" id="rfig17">FIGURE 17</a></h3>
<p>Andirons or fire-dogs were used in every
house, for all fires were of wood and in fireplaces.
The poorer people were content with
very simple andirons, made of wrought or cast
iron and without any ornament. In these, the
standards are made tall and they have as ornaments
little vase-forms of brass at their tops.</p>
<p>Tongs and shovel were as necessary as the
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
andirons, and like them were often of the
simplest make. These have handsome brass
handles.</p>
<h3 id="c23"><a href="#fig18" id="rfig18">FIGURE 18</a></h3>
<p>A toasting rack. Slices of bread were placed
on edge between the curved bars, and the rack
was then set before the fire. The flat strip of
iron to which the bars were fastened could be
made to revolve on the bar below, attached to
the handle so that when one side of the bread
was toasted, the other side was easily turned
to the fire.</p>
<h3 id="c24"><a href="#fig19" id="rfig19">FIGURE 19</a></h3>
<p>A gridiron, used not only for cooking meat
but also as a rest on which to set cooking utensils
of any kind, raising them above the coals
below. All utensils of this type stood on legs to
lift them a little above the coals and ashes.</p>
<h3 id="c25"><a href="#fig20" id="rfig20">FIGURE 20</a></h3>
<p>Knife-tray, used also for spoons. It was
handy and took the place of a drawer. In
many of the home-made tables for the kitchen
there was no drawer. The tray was usually
made of wood and very simple.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h3 id="c26"><a href="#fig21" id="rfig21">FIGURE 21</a></h3>
<p>Spectacles and Bible. The rings at the
ends of the frames gripped the head behind the
ears a little and helped to hold the spectacles
more securely. The rims and frames were
often made of iron and were then very heavy.</p>
<p>A big Bible like this, with brass corners and
clasps, was in many colonial homes. From it
the head of the house read aloud every morning
or evening. In it, on blank leaves between
the Old and New Testaments, was kept the
&ldquo;Family Record,&rdquo; that is, a list of births, marriages
and deaths with dates, sometimes going
back for several generations.</p>
<h3 id="c27"><a href="#fig22" id="rfig22">FIGURE 22</a></h3>
<p>A wheel for spinning flax. At this wheel
the spinner, almost always a woman, sat to
spin. The process was quite similar to that
followed with a wool-wheel; but the wheel was
made to revolve by a pedal like that on a sewing
machine.</p>
<h3 id="c28"><a href="#fig23" id="rfig23">FIGURE 23</a></h3>
<p>A powder-horn. Powder was almost always
carried in a horn. The horn was usually home
made and very simple. A cow&rsquo;s horn, which is
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
hollow, was patiently scraped on the inside until
it was smooth and as thin as the maker desired.
In the larger end was fitted a bottom of wood,
and in this was fastened a ring or a nail. The
small end was cut off to give a hole of proper
size. In the horn was cut a rim or groove. To
this groove and to the ring in the bottom a
stout cord was fastened, which passed over the
hunter&rsquo;s shoulder and held the horn at a convenient
place at his right side. The opening was
stopped by a wooden plug, so made that it
could be easily removed and held in the teeth,
so that the hunter might have both hands free
to pour out the powder. Often a smaller horn
was carried in the pocket to hold a finer and
quicker-acting powder to fill the pan for firing.
Being finer, it entered the hole more easily and
joined the powder of the main charge. Being
quicker-acting, it helped to lessen the &ldquo;hang
fire&rdquo; habit.</p>
<h3 id="c29"><a href="#fig24" id="rfig24">FIGURE 24</a></h3>
<p>A swift, which was fastened to the edge of a
table by a thumb-screw. A skein of yarn was
placed on it just as it was expanded, like an
umbrella, and then, the swift turning as the
yarn was pulled, the yarn could be easily wound
from it into a ball or on to a spool.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
